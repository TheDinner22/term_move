# just tryna learn go

this program will
- listen for key presses
- display a grid in the terminal
- pressing the arrow keys will move ur character (literally) up, down, left, or right

### tkanking 

- grid struct that holds all state
- some kind of listener callback or loop
- when a key is presed, update state of grid
- every "frame", render the grid to the terminal

```
maybe only render if there has been a change? idk
```
